# My_portfolio_website.html
This is My general portfolio website, which I created as a task during my internship with Bharat Intern.
Designed with the primary goal of providing a platform for deepening my skills in front-end development, specifically
HTML and CSS.
Skill Enhancement: Through the development of this portfolio, I aim to gain a comprehensive understanding of
HTML and CSS, including their best practices, coding
conventions, and responsive design principles.
Confidence Building: By working hands-on with these essential web development languages, I will not only acquire practical
experience but also boost my confidence in tackling more complex coding challenges.
